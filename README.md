# Pokémon Yellow: Swap Battle Edition

This is a Pokémon Yellow hack where you swap teams with the enemy trainer after
every battle and fight them one more time with your Pokémon switched.

The idea behind this hack is to provide a unique challenge to Yellow,
especially forcing you not to fight with overleveled teams or rely too heavily
on one Pokémon.

Here's how it works:

    - The enemy trainer will fight you with your Pokémon as they were at the
      start of the battle. This means you can fight with reduced HP/PP or
      status effects, and the trainer will have to fight you with those
      same limitations. Itemless runs are encouraged!
    - After beating the trainer with your Pokémon swapped, you get back your
      Pokémon as they were when you beat the enemy trainer's team.
    - If your Pokémon reach a level where they will evolve, they'll evolve
      after you beat the trainer with your original team, not after swapping.
    - Only trainers swap Pokémon with you. You don't swap Pokémon with wild
      encounters. Link battles have not been tested.
    - If you black out, you won't swap.

This hack is based on [pret's decompilation of Pokémon Yellow](https://github.com/pret/pokeyellow).
